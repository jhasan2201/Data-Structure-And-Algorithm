#### GCD/LCM:
20. Write a recursive program to find the GCD of x and y where x, y are positive integers.
    (Hint: use Euclid's algorithm. Two ways to solve this.)
21. Write a recursive program to find the LCM of x and y where x, y are positive integers.
    (Two ways to solve this)
    Digits
22. Write a recursive program to count the number of digits of an integer.
23. Write a recursive program to find the sum of digits of an integer.
24. Write a recursive program to check if a given positive integer is a palindrome or not. An
    integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
